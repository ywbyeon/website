Nelson Bighetti is a professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab. His research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. He leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Materials Sciences Division of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory trying to unravel the mystery of buried interphases between a solid-state electrolyte and a metal anode via advanced electron microscopy.
